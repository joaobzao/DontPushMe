# WIP: DontPushMe

A simple tool to test iOS push notifications.

## Motivation

The [pusher app](https://github.com/noodlewerk/NWPusher) seems to be legacy and apparently stopped working, as per [this issue](https://github.com/noodlewerk/NWPusher/issues/80#issue-864880443)
So this is just a tool to fulfill the gap pusher left.

> APNs will not support legacy binary protocol as of March 31, 2021.
